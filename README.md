# Todo App

A simple yet powerful Todo application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Manage tasks with priorities, track completion status, switch themes, and persist data using local storage.

## Project Overview

This Todo App allows users to create, manage, and track tasks with different priority levels (high, medium, low). It features a clean interface with theme switching, task sorting by priority, and real-time stats for total and completed tasks. The app saves tasks and theme preferences to local storage for persistence across sessions.

### Features
- **Task Management**: Add, toggle (complete/undo), and delete tasks.
- **Priority Levels**: Assign high, medium, or low priority to tasks, with visual indicators.
- **Sorting**: Tasks are automatically sorted by priority (high to low).
- **Stats**: Displays total tasks and completed tasks.
- **Theme Switching**: Choose between different themes (e.g., default, dark) via a dropdown.
- **Persistence**: Tasks and theme preferences are saved to local storage.
- **Clear All**: Option to remove all tasks with a confirmation prompt.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes (assumes CSS support).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the todo interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for layout, themes, and priority indicators (assumed in `styles.css`).
- **JavaScript**: Class-based app logic, event handling, and local storage management.
